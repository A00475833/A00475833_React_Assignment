        <p>
          Hello! I'm Siddharth Singh. I have earned a Bachelor of Technology
          degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Medi-Caps University,
          Indore. Following the completion of my engineering degree, I joined
          Cognizant Technology Solutions as a Programmer Analyst. During my
          two-year tenure at Cognizant, I had the opportunity to learn and have
          a lot of fun!
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeking to expand my knowledge in Computer Science further, I am
          currently enrolled in the MSc CDA Program at Saint Mary's University,
          Halifax. In my leisure time, I am passionate about watching MMA and
          Boxing.
